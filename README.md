# Snake-Game

This game is an imitation of the conventional classic snake game.
The score is updated each time the snake eats the food.
The player loses the game when the snake bites its own body part.
The snake can navigate up, down, left and right using the up-arrow, dowm-arrow, left-arrow and right-arrow keys in the keyboard.
